====================

Library to generate Time-based One-Time Passwords.
Implements the Time-based One-Time Password algorithm specified in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238). Supports different time steps and it's compatible with tokens that uses the same standard (including software ones, like the Google Authenticator app).
